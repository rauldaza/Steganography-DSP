# Digital Signal Processing & Steganography Project

This repository contains practical experiments in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) applied to images and audio, with a particular focus on **steganography** â€” the art of hiding information inside multimedia content.

## Project Structure

- **estega_file.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook implementing DSP and steganography techniques.
- **audios/**: Test audio files used in experiments.
- **imagenes/**: Image files used as carriers or hidden content.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Processing and analyzing audio/image signals using Python.
- Steganographic techniques for information hiding.
- Use of scientific computing libraries: NumPy, imageio, etc.
- Visualization and interactive documentation with Jupyter Notebooks.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `estega_file.ipynb` using Jupyter or VS Code.
3. Run the cells to execute the experiments and view results.
